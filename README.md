A Power Bar on the right side has a lever which keeps moving from highest to lowest range
    Red indicates Maximum throw power
        shots which are taken farther away from the basket should be in this zone
    Green indicates medium throw power
        shots which are taken somewhere in between should be in this zone 
    Yellow indicates low throw power 
        shots which are taken from near the basket should be in this zone
 
Press spacebar to lock on one of the above three zones

Not yet Fully Implemented

    only partial trajectory of the ball is displayed after launch 
        need to figure out how to make the ball fall smoothly after it reaches max height
      
    can add an Image of basketball floor to make it look more awesome
 
    works only from the middle and left side
        should be an easy fix, right side implementation after the left side works perfectly

    Reducing the size of ball as it approaches the basket would give a more realistic effect
        pygame.transform.scale
